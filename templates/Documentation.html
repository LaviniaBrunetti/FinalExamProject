			<p>
				Developing this web application was not an easy task. <br>
				This project came with many challenges that had to be faced and many problems that had to be solved. <br>
				But, despite the hardships, working on this project was a great way to get hands-on in a complex project that required a lot of different components to work together. 
			</p>
			<h2>Software Analysis</h2>
			<p>After reading the project specifications, the first thing to do was figure out what were the main requirements that had to be met. 
				While trying to define the main features of the software, we explored a few different paths, performing quick tests on sample dataframes to see which one suited best. 
				Once we had defined the main problems that were to be addressed, we settled down for the layout that we were more comfortable with. 
				This translated in the CRC cards (available below) which encapsulate the main features of the project. 
			</p>
			<h2>Software Design</h2>
			<p>The next step consisted in finding a way to translate the CRC cards in well defined classes. <br>
			To do so, we built a UML class diagram (available below) where we represented each class as well as the attributes and methods they had to implement. We also included all the required modules and the relationship between classes, paying attenction to the type of interaction. 
			<br>
			This step required a lot of back and forth as well as a lot of failed attempts, but in the end resulted in a well-defined structure for our software. 
			In our view, the solution we designed is capable of capturing all needs and implementing all the required features. 
			</p>
			<h2>Software Implementation</h2>
			<p>Once we achieved an acceptable design for the software, it was time to translate it into python code. 
				We tried to implement the software in a way that optimized the code, paying attention to avoid redundant lines and to build the classes and methods at the best of our abilities. <br> <br>
				We started by implementing the reader classes, which are in a separate module as to avoid confusion when running the code. <br>
				We designed the interface and then implemented the actual concrete reader. Once done, we tested out the GffReader on the Human Genome Annotation File and ensured it was correctly parsing the file and returning a DataFrame object. (once we implemented the Dataset class we came back and modified the reader as to return a Dataset instead)
				<br>
				Then, we created a new file where we built the Dataset classes as well as the Operation classes. We kept them in the same module because they are strongly dependent from one another, and creating separate files would have lead to circular import problems. 
				The general Dataset class was built, including the attributes and methods defined in the UML diagram (see below), and then subclassed it into a specific GffDataset class that adds a method to easily access the attributes, since they are stored as a unique string in the DataFrame. <br>
				After doing that, we tested the code and fixed the (numerous) bugs we encountered. 
				<br>
				Next, we created an abstract class called Operation, with a private register of active operations that has to be checked before allowing the execution of an operation. We then implemented the methods to access that registry and, finally, we started to define the behaviour of the operations. <br>
				To do so, we implemented a .run() method. This creates a surface-level enviroment that allows to run any operation without worrying about the actual behaviour of the specific operation. <br>
				This can be done as the .run() method ensures that the caller object is a Dataset or one of its subclasses and, if this is the case, it passes the arguments to the _execute() function, specific for each subclass. Once done, it stores the result of the operation and returns a new DataSet containing the result. <br>
				<br>
				We then build each individual subclass by overriding the ._execute() abstract method (protected to prevent the execution from outside a Dataset object), as to define individual behaviour. 
				<br>
				The final step was to perform a lot of testing-adjusting until the code was able to run with no errors. We tested as many settings as we could think of until we were able to fully run the code. 
			</p>

			<h2>Web App implementation</h2>
			<p>When we obtained a code that was able to meet our requirements, we moved on and created a new python file that contained the Flask app. We designed all the app routes with basic templates and adjusted the software until all the links, variables and features in general worked as intended. <br>
			To do so it was of crucial importance to properly set the organization of the app folder, as to make sure that all the files were accessible and worked as intended. 
			Once the app was successfully running, the final step was to design a nice interface. <br>
			To do so we used HTML,CSS and a lot of google search. This step was a little bit harder as none of us was familiar with advanced HTML or CSS, nonetheless we tried to solve one problem at a time until we obtained a web interface we were satisfied with.<br>
			We then tested the app on different computers to check if the interface would still work as intended. 
			</p>

			<h2 >Writing Documentation</h2>
			<p>The very last step was providing documentation for the developing process. We heavily relied on the notes we had taken in the whole process and tried to provide a cohesive and informative summary of our work. </p>

								This picture shows the CRC cards for this web application. <br> <br>
								The first step in the developement of this project was sketching out the main classes that the application required, as well as the responsibilities for each of them. <br>
								<br>
								<b>DataSetReader</b> <br>
								This is an interface that defines the general procedure for reading a file and generating a Dataset. <br>
								This class must be implemented as to allow subclassing for different kinds of readers, that parse files of different formats. Therefore it must be general enough to allow easy implementation of such specific readers. <br>
								A DatasetReader must be able to check the format of a file and, if the format is compatible, generate e specific Dataset that contains a pandas.Dataframe of the data.
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>GFFReader</b> <br>
								This is the realization of the DatasetReader, designed to deal specifically with GFF3 files. Therefore it must check whether the file format is "gff3" and if so proceed with reading the file and creating a GffDataset. <br>
								Since the gff3 files contain lines that must be skipped, as they contain comments or other kind of data, the reader must be capable of recognising those lines and skip over them. <br>
								Another requirement for the reader is that the data that are passed need to be casted in the correct datatype.  
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Dataset</b> <br>
								This is the object that is returned by the reader. It is a wrapper object that contains the data from the parsed file. <br>
								To do so, each instance must store the dataframe in a self.df attribute that allows access to the data.
								<br>
								Moreover, Dataset objects must allow access to the Operations, and when an operation is performed, the Dataset object must store the result of such operation. <br>
								In order to achieve this, the Dataset class implements a self.result attribute that is by default set to "unavailable" when a Dataset is created by the Reader. <br>
								Instead, when the Dataset is created by performing an operation, the self.result attribute is responsible for storing such output. 
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>GFFDataset </b>
								<br>
								This is a specific type of dataset that is meant to deal with GFF-derived dataframes. It inherits the structure of a generic Dataset object but sets up a specialized enviroment that makes it easy to work with GFF3 files. 
								<br>
								<br>
								<b>Operation </b> <br> 
								This is an abstract class that defines the generic behaviour for an Operation. It contains a register of active operation and some methods to access such register as to coordinate the activity of the dataset and the operation. It must provide a method that allows to run the operation regardless of the specific instructions, so that any operation can be simply run without worring about specificities. 
								<br>
								It must also define an abstract method that will then be implemented by each subclass. Such method contains the instrunctions for the specific operation. 
								<br>
								In this image the specific operations are not shown. This is because for all of them the procedure simply consists in the implementation of the method _execute() as to define how must the specific operation act on the dataset.

							<p > 
							This picture shows the UML diagram for this web application. <br> 
							The next step in project developement was figuring out how the program needed to be designed, therfore an UML class diagram was created, which contains all the classes and their methods. <br>
							<b>DataSetReader</b> <br>
							An interface class for a general Dataset reader.<br> 
							Such interface contains the signature for two public abstract methods : <br>
							-<b>check_format(filename)</b> is used to ensure that the file is in the correct format. It returns a boolean value. 
							<br>
							-<b>read(filename)</b> is responsible for reading the file and returning a Dataset object. 
							<br>					
							The implementation of such interface allows possible future implementation of other specialized readers, meant to parse different file formats. 
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>GFFReader</b> <br>
							A realization of DatasetReader, specific for the GFF3 format. The inherited abstract methods are defined in this class in the following manner: 
							<br>
							-<b>check_format(filename)</b> checks for the presence of "gff-version   3" in the file and, if found, returns "True", otherwise returns "False" 
							<br>
							-<b>read(filename)</b> relies on the aforementioned check_format method to check if the file is in the right format and, if so, proceeds to parse it and returns a GFFDataset object. 
							<br>
							These two methods are implemented as static methods as to avoid the need to create a reader object to parse the file. It is indeed possible to call the method with the syntax GFFReader.read(filename). 
							<br>
							This class uses the python module "pandas" to generate the underying DataFrame and to cast the datatypes. 
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>Dataset</b> <br>
							The class dataset defines an object type that encloses a pd.DataFrame. It is returned by a DatasetReader.read() method. <br> 
							The constructor for a DataSet object defines two attributes: <br>
							-<b>self.df </b> is a pandas dataframe object, generated by the reader by parsing the file. 
							<br>
							-<b>self.result</b> stores the result of an operation and is defaulted to a string "Unavailable". This is because when a Dataset is created, no operations are performed over it and therefore there is no result to show. On the other hand, when an Operation is performed, the new dataset will show the result of the operation as self.result.
							<br>
							It also defines two public instance methods: 
							<br>
							-<b>.show()</b> prints self.df with all nine columns visible
							<br>
							-<b>.show_result()</b> returns the value of self.result
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>GFFDataset </b>
							<br>
							A subclass of Dataset, it inherits both the attributes and the methods from Dataset and implements a new method: <br>
							-<b>attributes_dict(df)</b> a class method that creates a nested dictionary of attributes for each entry in the dataframe. <br>  
							It is implemented as a class method so that is not bound to a specific instance and can be called as GFFDataset.attributes_dict(dataframe)
							<br>
							<br>
							<b>Operation </b> <br> 
							An abstract class that defines the main featurs of an operation. <br>
							Operations are only accessible by a Dataset instance (therefore also subclasses of Dataset). 
							<br>
							The class contains: <br>
							-<b> __register</b>: a private class attribute containing a list of active operations. The Dataset can access all active operations. 
							<br> 
							-<b>._get_register </b> is a protected static method that allows access to the register. 
							<br>
							-<b>._set_register </b> is a protected static method that allows modify the register. 
							<br>
							-<b>._append_register </b> is a protected static method that allows to append items to the the register. 
							<br>
							-<b> .run() </b> This method takes a caller as argument, checks if it is an instance of Dataset and, if so, it calls the specific subclass _execute() method, also passing kwargs, if any. It then returns the result of the operation in the form of a new dataset object <br>
							-<b> ._execute() </b> is a protected abstract method that is ment to define the specific behaviour of the operation subclass. 
							<br> 
							-<b>Manager</b>: Allows coordination the activity of the dataset and the state of the operations, only allowing active operations to be executed. 
							
							<br>
							<br> 
							Each specific Operation is shown as a subclass (and therfore a realization) of the abstract class Operation. Each of these overrides the ._execute() method and specifies the specific behaviour of the subclass. When an object of an operation is created, the attribute self.name is automatically set to the correct value, specific for each class.
							<br>
							<br>
							The rest of the UML diagram shows the webapp layout. It is an instance of the class Flask, which also relies on jinja and contains four different app routes:
							-<b>Homepage</b> <br>
							-<b>Active Operations</b> <br>
							-<b>Operation</b> <br>
							-<b>Documentation</b> <br>
							<br>
							The connectors between the routes show the navigability of the webapp. </p>
